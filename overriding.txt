1. Create a base class Fruit with name ,taste and size as
     its attributes.

    Create a method called eat() which describes the name of
    the fruit and its taste.

    Inherit the same in 2 other classes Apple and Orange and
    override the eat() method to represent each fruit taste.


CODE- 

class Fruit {
      String name;
      String taste;
       int size;
	
       void eat() {
	System. out. println ( " Name of the fruit is: " + name ) ;
	System. out. println ( " Taste of the fruit is: " + taste ) ;  
	}
	
}

class Apple extends Fruit
{

     void eat ( ) // overriding method
  {
       System. out. println ( " Name of the fruit is Apple " ) ;
       System. out. println ( " Taste of the fruit is sweet " ) ;
    }  
}
class Orange extends Fruit
{
	
     void eat ( ) // overriding method
  {
       System. out. println ( " Name of the fruit is Orange " ) ;
       System. out. println ( " Taste of the fruit is sour " ) ;
    }
}
public class test {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
        
		  Apple A = new Apple () ;
		     A . eat ( ) ;
		    Orange O = new Orange () ;
		    O . eat ( ) ;
	}

}



OUTPUT:  Name of the fruit is Apple 
               Taste of the fruit is sweet 
               Name of the fruit is Orange 
               Taste of the fruit is sour 




2. Write a program to create a class named shape. It should
contain 2 methods, draw() and erase() that prints
“Drawing Shape” and “Erasing Shape” respectively.

For this class, create three sub classes, Circle,
Triangle and Square and each class should override the
parent class functions - draw () and erase ().

The draw() method should print “Drawing Circle”, “Drawing
Triangle” and “Drawing Square” respectively.
The erase() method should print “Erasing Circle”,
“Erasing Triangle” and “Erasing Square” respectively.

Create objects of Circle, Triangle and Square in the
following way and observe the polymorphic nature of the
class by calling draw() and erase() method using each
object.

Shape c=new Circle();
Shape t=new Triangle();
Shape s=new Square();



CODE:
   
 class shape {
	
	void draw() {
		System.out.println("Drawing Shape");
	}
	
	void erase() {
		System.out.println("Erasing Shape");
	}
}

class Circle extends shape {
	
	void draw() {
		System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
	}
	
	void erase() {
		System.out.println("Erasing Circle");
	}
}

class Triangle extends shape {
	
	void draw() {
		System.out.println("Drawing Triangle");
	}
	
	void erase() {
		System.out.println("Erasing Triangle");
	}
}

class Square extends shape {
	
	void draw() {
		System.out.println("Drawing Square");
	}
	
	void erase() {
		System.out.println("Erasing Square");
	}
}
public class math {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

		shape c=new Circle();
		shape t=new Triangle();
		shape s=new Square();
		c.draw();
		c.erase();
		t.draw();
		t.erase();
		s.draw();
		s.erase();
	}

}


OUTPUT: Drawing Circle
               Erasing Circle
                Drawing Triangle
                Erasing Triangle
                Drawing Square
                Erasing Square
